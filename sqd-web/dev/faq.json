			{"q":"Squidle links don't load in the app, instead they load in my browser. How do I fix this?","a":"Some aps use their own web browsers to load links - if this is your situation please try loading the link in your normal web browser, or if the option exists load into the Squilder app. Sometimes the default loading behaviour has been changed accidentally by the user, to fix this: Android - Go to settings, then apps, then find the app where the Squidle link is not loading correctly from and select 'clear defaults', then try loading the link again, iOS -  Long hold on a Squidle link and it should give you the option to load in the Squidler app"}
